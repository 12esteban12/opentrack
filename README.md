## Intro

opentrack project home at <<http://github.com/opentrack/opentrack>>.

Downloads are at <<https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases>>.

Please first refer to <<https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/wiki>>
for new user guide, frequent questions, specific tracker/filter
documentation.

**Railway planning software** <<http://opentrack.ch>> had the name `opentrack` first. Apologies for the long-standing naming conflict.

## Usage

`opentrack` is an application dedicated to tracking user's head
movements and relaying the information to games and flight simulation
software.

`opentrack` allows for output shaping, filtering, and operating with many input and output devices and protocols; the codebase runs Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX (currently unmaintained), and GNU/Linux.

Don't be afraid to submit an **issue/feature request** if need arises.

# License and warranty

Almost all code is licensed under the [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license). There are very few proprietary dependencies. There is no copyleft code. See individual files for licensing and authorship information.

See [WARRANTY.txt](WARRANTY.txt) for applying warranty terms (that is, disclaiming possible pre-existing warranty) that are in force unless the software author specifies their own warranty terms. In short, we disclaim all possible warranty and aren't responsible for any possible damage or losses.

The code is held to a high-quality standard and written with utmost care; consider this a promise without legal value. Despite doing the best we can not to injure users' equipment, software developers don't want to be dragged to courts for imagined or real issues. Disclaiming warranty is a standard practice in the field, even for expensive software like operating systems.

# Building opentrack from source

On Windows, use either mingw-w64 or MS Visual Studio 2015 Update 3/newer. On other platforms use GNU or LLVM. Refer to [Visual C++ 2015 build instructions](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/wiki/Building-under-MS-Visual-C---2017-and-later).
